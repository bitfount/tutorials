    "This tutorial uses the same census-income-demo Pod as you did in \"Running a Pod\". **However**, we will not be using the Federated Averaging algorithm. Rather, we will use the Results Only algorithm. This algorithm allows us to train/evaluate without having to send weight updates back and forth; all training happens entirely on the target Pod, and no weight updates are sent back to the data scientist. This makes it perfect for when we want to run evaluation remotely!\n",
