    "### Creating a custom model\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we will create a custom model, extending and overriding the built-in `BitfountModel` class (specifically, we will use the `PyTorchBitfountModel` class). Details on this can be found in the documentation in the `bitfount.backends.pytorch.models.bitfount_model` module. Note, Bitfount does not vet custom models, nor are custom models private. Custom models saved to the Hub are searchable by users who know the URL for the custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PyTorchBitfountModel` uses the [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) library to provide high-level implementation options for a model in the PyTorch framework. This enables you to only implement the methods you need to dictate how the model training should be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our custom model we _need_ to implement the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__()`: how to setup the model\n",
    "- `configure_optimizers()`: how optimizers should be configured in the model\n",
    "- `forward()`: how to perform a forward pass in the model, how the loss is calculated\n",
    "- `training_step()`: what one training step in the model looks like\n",
    "- `validation_step()`: what one validation step in the model looks like\n",
    "- `test_step()`: what one test step in the model looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we implement the custom model, feel free to try out your own model here:"
