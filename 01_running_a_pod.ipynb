    "# Federated Learning - Part 1: Running a pod\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Bitfount federated learning tutorials! In this sequence of tutorials, you will learn how federated learning works on the Bitfount platform. This is the first notebook in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first tutorial introduces the concept of Pods (Processor of Data). A Pod is the component of the Bitfount network which allows for models or queries to run on remote data. Pods are co-located with data, check that users are authorised to perform a given operation, and then execute any approved computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this Jupyter notebook, you should know how to run a Pod by interacting with the Bitfount Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, create your Bitfount account at https://hub.bitfount.com. If you'd like to run these tutorials locally, activate your virtual environment, download the files into a directory on your virtual environment, and open a Jupyter notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in your preferred terminal client.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a Pod, we must import the relevant pieces from our [API reference](https://docs.bitfount.com/api/bitfount/federated/pod) for constructing a Pod. While several of these are optional, it is best practice to import them all for flexibility."
