    "# Private Set Intersections - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Private set intersection (PSI) is a privacy-preserving technique which falls under the umbrella of secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technologies. These technologies enable multiple parties to perform operations on disparate datasets without revealing the underlying data to any party using cryptographic techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "PSI itself allows you to determine the _overlapping_ records in two disparate datasets without providing access to the underlying raw data of either dataset, hence why it is referred to as an _intersection_. When applied to the Bitfount context, a Data Scientist can perform a PSI across a local dataset and a specified Pod and return the matching records from the local dataset.\n",
