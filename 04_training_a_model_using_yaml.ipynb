    "how to do the same using a YAML configuration file.\n",
    "You will use the Pod you set up in Part 2, so make sure you start that Pod first. If needed, you can go back and run [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/bitfount/tutorials/blob/main/02_running_a_pod_using_yaml.ipynb) to run the Pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you will need to receive access to a Pod from the Data Custodian who owns the Pod to query or train on its associated data. The Data Custodian will need your Bitfount username to grant you access. Once access is granted, you will be able to view whether the Pod is online and what permissions you have to it in the \"Accessible Pods\" view in the Hub.\n",
