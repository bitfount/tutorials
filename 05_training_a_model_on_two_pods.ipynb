    "In order to use secure aggregation, we specify an additional parameter `aggregator = SecureAggregator()`\n",

    "The `SecureAggregator` is essentially a secure multi-party computation algorithm based on additive secret sharing. Its goal is to compute weight averages, without revealing the raw weight values resulting from training input Pod data accessible to end-users.\n",

    "   update), which will be shared.\n",
    "2. The tensors in the weight update are then converted to positive integer field\n",
    "   elements of a finite field bounded by `prime_q`.\n",
    "3. The random numbers generated are used to compute a final share for every\n",
    "   tensor in the weight update. This final share has the same shape as the secret\n",
    "   tensor.\n",
    "4. This final share is then reconstructed using the shares retrieved from the\n",
    "   other workers. At this point, the final share from each worker is meaningless\n",
    "   until averaged with every other weight update.\n",
    "5. This final share is sent to the modeller where it will be averaged with the\n",
    "   updates from all the other workers (all the while in the finite field space).\n",
    "6. After averaging, the updates are finally decoded back to floating point\n",
    "   tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `SecureAggregation` can be done only on Pods that have been approved to work with one another.\n",
    "If you look back at Tutorial 1, we specified `census-income-demo` as part of the `approved_pods` when\n",
    "defining the `census-income-demo` Pod, and in Tutorial 2 we specified `census-income-demo` as one of the `other_pods`\n",
    "that the `census-income-yaml-demo` Pod can work with for secure aggregation.\n",
