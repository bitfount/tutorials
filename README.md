# Introduction

The tutorials in the side panel walk you through the simple process of setting up a Bitfount Pod, as well as running different types of analysis and machine learning tasks against the data within one or more Pods.

We recommend copying and pasting the code blocks from these guides into your own notebook tool to try them out!

[//]: # 'These tutorials have an "Open in Colab" button that will allow you to run them within [Google Colab](https://colab.google), or you can download them to run in your own notebook ecosystem.'
[//]: # "TODO: [BIT-4594] Can relink to the tutorials repo once this issue is resolved"
[//]: # "We recommend downloading the tutorials as notebooks [here](https://github.com/bitfount/tutorials) or copy and pasting the code blocks from these guides into your own notebook tool."

[//]: # 'Alternatively, if you\'d prefer not to download the tutorials, most tutorials can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.google). Tutorials compatible with Google Colab have a link at the top named "Open in Colab" and by clicking it should take you to a new Colab session where you can run the tutorial in isolation.'

Once you’ve tried these hosted tutorials, visit the [Getting Started](https://docs.bitfount.com/guides/getting-started/introduction-to-bitfount) guide to get up and running with your own Bitfount installation!
