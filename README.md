# Introduction

The tutorials in the side panel walk you through the simple process of setting up a Bitfount Pod, as well as running different types of analysis and machine learning tasks against the data within one or more Pods.

We recommend downloading the tutorials as notebooks [here](https://github.com/bitfount/tutorials) or copy and pasting the code blocks from these guides into your own notebook tool.

Alternatively, if you'd prefer not to download the tutorials, most tutorials can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.google). Tutorials compatible with Google Colab have a link at the top named "Open in Colab" and by clicking it should take you to a new Colab session where you can run the tutorial in isolation.

Once youâ€™ve tried these hosted tutorials, visit the [Getting Started](https://docs.bitfount.com/guides/getting-started/introduction-to-bitfount) guide to get up and running with your own Bitfount installation!
