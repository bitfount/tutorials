    "### Creating a custom model\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we will create a custom model, extending and overriding the built-in `BitfountModel` class (specifically, we will use the `PyTorchBitfountModelv2` class). Details on this can be found in the documentation in the `bitfount.backends.pytorch.models.bitfount_model` module. Models uploaded to the Hub are private by default but can be made public if desired. You can view your uploaded models here: https://hub.bitfount.com/models\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PyTorchBitfountModelv2` uses the [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) library to provide high-level implementation options for a model in the PyTorch framework. This enables you to only implement the methods you need to dictate how the model training should be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our custom model we _need_ to implement the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__()`: how to setup the model\n",
    "- `configure_optimizers()`: how optimizers should be configured in the model\n",
    "- `create_model()`: how to create the model\n",
    "- `forward()`: how to perform a forward pass in the model, how the loss is calculated\n",
    "- `_training_step()`: what one training step in the model looks like\n",
    "- `_validation_step()`: what one validation step in the model looks like\n",
    "- `_test_step()`: what one test step in the model looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we implement the custom model, feel free to try out your own model here:"
